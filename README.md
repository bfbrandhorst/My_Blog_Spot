# My_Blog_Spot
My personal blog is designed to showcase a user's thoughts and experiences. When a user visits the page, they are simply asked to enter their Username, Title, and then fill in the content! After selecting the "submit" button they will be directed to a new page where all blog entries can be viewed along with the username and the title of entry. All submissions are locally stored and can be viewed in inspection. Also, change your view to dark mode! Some users prefer a darker screen, just one click and it's done.  Once finished you can opt to "go back" where a clean submission form will be waiting for your next round of thoughts! Thanks for visiting and make sure to check out my portfolio page linked below the entries!
